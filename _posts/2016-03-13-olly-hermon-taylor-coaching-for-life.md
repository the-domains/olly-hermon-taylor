# Olly Hermon-Taylor: Coaching For Life
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/26a06f4b-7591-41ce-a788-f42f3c02ce63.jpg)

As a coach, my goal is to help you breakthrough limiting beliefs and patterns of behaviour and get out of the rut you're in so you can move forwards with your life in all areas: Mind, Body, Relationships and Business, Happiness.

With my team of hand-picked professionals, I want to help you to stop settling for less than you're worth and less than you're capable of.

Whether you're a coach or trainer yourself, busy Mum or Dad, or CEO and entrepreneur, you have to stop making excuses to yourself and start to take action towards achieving your health, fitness and lifestyle goals.

My coaching programmes are immersive and require consistency and commitment. They're designed to help you "press the reset button" and take control of your life, so that you can improve your Physical Intelligence (PQ) and unleash your potential as a human being, athlete, parent, business owner, leader, friend and member of society.

Working with me will be challenging, because I'm going to call you out on the limiting stories you tell yourself and the destructive, self-sabotaging behaviours that are holding you back from achieving your goals and dreams.

I want to help you break the cycle of failure and self-sabotage and kiss goodbye to False Hope Syndrome, once and for all, so you can start to live the life you want and deserve.

It's very important to understand that this is not another diet or exercise programme, something that you adopt for a couple of months before returning to normal life.

If that is what you're after, then I'm afraid I won't be able to help you.

Instead of being another quick fix, or the latest fad to try for a few weeks before you fall off the wagon, I want to help you**upgrade your mindset** and **create a new, healthy lifestyle** that delivers **realistic and sustainable results.**

There is no "one size fits all approach" with my coaching and all lifestyle, exercise and nutrition programmes will be completely individualised to your unique needs.

**Coaching Overview**

**Step One: Upgrade Your Mindset**  
Using a mixture of behavioural change psychology, self-sabotage emotional coaching and healing work and many other coaching tehcniques (depending on your learning style) the first goal is to overhaul your mindset and upgrade your belief systems. In particular, we'll be looking for the unconscious, limiting and destructive patterns and beliefs that are holding you back.

Mindset is the key to achieving lasting results.

**Step Two: Real Food**  
Depending on your current state of health, we'll use very in depth assessments and screening tools to determine the right starting point for your nutritional programme. Based on your individual needs, we may use state-of-the-art lab testing, including Food Sensitivity Testing, Comprehensive Blood Chemistry, Stool Analysis, Cortisol Rhythm Testing.

The goal of this phase is to optimise your digestion and repair your gut health, so that your body can then absorb and assimilate all of the key nutrients from the food you eat. This step is vital if you have any long-term digestive issues or have struggled to lose weight, particularly excess fat around your middle.

Following testing and analysis and any recommendations and protocols that come out of the process, the next step is to reset your eating habits and support your body with high-quality, Real Food, with a goal of building true health from the inside out.

**Step Three: Movement**

Using industry-leading screening and assessment tools, we'll build a picture of your body in terms of structure, posture and movement quality. In particular, we'll identify any asymmetries, imbalances and dysfunctional movement patterns, so that we can design a corrective exercise programme to rebalance your body, reclaim mobility at key joints, activate and strengthen your deep core and rehabilitate any recurring injuries, back, shoulder, neck, hip or knee pain and return you to leading an active, pain-free lifestyle.

As soon as we're satisfied that your body is realigned and you've built a foundation of stability and high-quality movement patterns, we'll then design progressive, individualised exercise programmes designed to help you reach your goals, including but not limited to:

* Body Composition (losing excess body fat and increasing lean muscle mass)
* Fitness (general fitness or train for a specific event)
* Strength Endurance 
* Hypertrophy (build lean muscle mass)
* Strength (improve overall strength or focus on key lifts)
* Power (explosive power for work, life or sport)
* Metabolic Conditioning (great for improving general fitness and burning fat)
